==============

This is a simple api made in python using fast api

Api delivers a list of friends and its relatives


## Running

```make build && make container```

## Docs

Docs are auto generated by fast api on
```
http://0.0.0.0:8000/docs
```
You can try out requests on the fly

## Running locally
```make server```

## Testing
```make test```


### How it works

* `app/core` - has all friends logic
* `app/routes` - has all routes built with fast api
    get_data acts as dependency injection for friends data
* `app/tests` - has all tests
* `app/main.py` - inits the server loaded by uvicorn
